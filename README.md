# KARAMOJA-PROJECT
END OF PHASE PROJECT
INTRODUCTION
The Karamoja sub-region, commonly known as Karamoja, is a region in Uganda. It covers an area of 27,528km and comprises the Kotido District, Kaabong District, Karenga District, Nabilatuk District, Abim District, Moroto District, Napak District, Amudat District and Nakapiripirit District.

BUSINESS OVERVIEW

Dalberg Data Insights (DDI) is collaborating with NGOs in Karamoja to enhance food security monitoring through data-driven insights. The methodology developed by DDIâ€™s agri-tech team involves using satellite images to estimate crop yields for sorghum and maize, the two main staple crops in the region. The model has already been tested for the 2017 crop season, providing a foundation for further development.

The next step in this initiative is to create an interactive visualization

DATA UNDERSTANDING

In the two datasets that i will use that is:

Karamoja district crop yield population

Karamoja subcounty crop yield population

we will find that the data is both categorical and numerical. During my data cleaning because of the data nature i will use both mean and mode for filling the missing values by the .fillna() method.

Below are the components of the above data:

Subcounty name

District name

POP: total population for the subcounty

Area

S_Yield_Ha: average yield for

RECOMMENDATIONS

Data Quality: Ensure the reliability and accuracy of the data source
External Factors: Consider external factors (e.g., climate change, policy changes) that might influence crop yields.

Data Privacy: Handle sensitive data (e.g., personal information) ethically and in compliance with regulations.

By following these recommendations, you can gain valuable insights into the relationship between crop yields, population, and other factors in the Karamoja region, which can inform policy decisions and agricultural development efforts.
